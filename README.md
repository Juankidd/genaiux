Design of a GenAI UX Layer with Small Language Models for Edge Computing in Smart Agriculture

📘 Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation associated with the study “Design of a GenAI UX Layer with Small Language Models for Edge Computing in Smart Agriculture”, developed by
Juan M. Núñez V., Carlos A. Peláez, Andrés Solano, Juan M. Corchado, and Fernando De la Prieta (University of Salamanca and Universidad Autónoma de Occidente).

The project proposes a GenAI-UX reference framework for integrating Small Language Models (SLMs) into Edge Computing environments, optimizing human–AI interaction through User Experience (UX) design principles and Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) guidelines.

🎯 Objectives

Design an Edge–IoT architecture with a GenAI-UX layer based on lightweight models (TinyLlama, DeepSeek).

Apply UX and HCAI principles to improve accessibility and usability for small and medium-sized agricultural producers.

Validate the impact of UX design on agronomic efficiency, reducing harvest cycles and improving productivity.
